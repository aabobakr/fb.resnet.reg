# fb.resnet.reg

A Torch framework for supervised regression tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). This implementation is based on the [fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch) repository by Facebook, Inc.

In addition to [ResNet-18,34,50,101,200](), this repository supports [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993), [ResNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431), [Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842), [VGG-11-13-16-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) and [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks). For the time being finetuning is available for ResNet and DenseNet models only.
